# Speech-Command-Recognition
In the past few years there has been a boost in research of machine learning algorithms in the field of audio processing. This has been possible now because of the
abundance of audio data available for analysis, specially speech data. This project explores various deep learning algorithms that can be applied to speech processing. In-depth analysis of the feature extraction techniques like Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC), and deep learning algorithms like Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM) and hybrid models like CNN + LSTM have been presented. The evaluation of these models have also been provided in the report.
